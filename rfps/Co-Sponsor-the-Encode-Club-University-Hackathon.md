You can view the details of our previous programs on our [website](https://www.encode.club/).

In terms of financial contributions, the funding for our events typically comes from various partners within the blockchain and DeFi space who recognize the value of investing in developer education and ecosystem growth.

In the past, we have applied for and received grants for other educational and hackathon initiatives. These grants have allowed us to expand our reach and impact significantly, enabling us to continue supporting the growth and development of the blockchain developer community.
